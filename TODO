- Change stack frames to use immutable data structures,
  so that tails calls and continuations would be easy to implement.
- Add more bytevector functions as specified in r6rs
- Begin working on a C FFI
  - idea for FFI: have a 'messaging' or 'event' interface,
    which can have multiple scheme functions registered to some key.
